 * This module runs in the MAIN process and should at least contain the application-wide configuration object and your application specifix SQL queries.
 * Just rename this file to `index.ts` and you're good to go.
 *
 * You may include additional custom logic that needs to run in the MAIN process, e.g. database related logic.
 * Using hooks it is possible to expose APIs to your RENDERER logic.
